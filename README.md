# TDA_Stocks

Our project aims to leverage Topological Data Analysis (TDA) techniques to identify complex,
non-linear patterns in financial stock market data, potentially enhancing market volatility
prediction and indicating market crashes. We intend to focus our analysis on high-dimensional
time series financial data such as daily stock prices, trading volumes, volatility indices, and other
technical market indicators that we might find relevant as we explore the topic further. We
expect that all of these data points should create a rich scope for TDA.
